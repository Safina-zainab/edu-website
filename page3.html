        THE FOUR IMPORTANT PILLARS OF OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
    </u></h1>

<img src="abstraction.png" width="40%"/>
<p style="font-size: larger;"> Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information to the outside world<br/>
    hiding their background details.To represent the needed information in program without<br/>
    presenting the deatils. Classes use the conepts of abstraction and are defined as a list<br/>
    The classes use the concept of data abstraction they are known as Abstract Data Type(ADT).
    </p> 
    <h2 style="text-align:center"> Data abstraction is one of the most powerful programming paradigms.</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> It allows us to create our own user defined data type.</li>
        <li> With data abstraction we think about what opertion can be performed</li>
        <li> Data abstraction is used as a tool to increase the modularity </li>
        <li> Data abstraction is used to built new abstract data types.</li>
    </ul>

    <img src ="encapsulation.png" width="40%"/>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">
    Encapsulation is the method of combining data and function inside a class.<br/>
    This hides data from being accessed from the outide world directly. only through function<br/>
    inside the class is able to access the information.when code and data are linked together in this<br/>
    an object is created.</p>
    <h2 style="text-align:center"> Keys points of Data abstraction:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> A wrapping of data and function into a single unit is known as Encapsulation.</li>
        <li> This hides data from  being accessed from the outside class  directlty .</li>
        <li>Data encapsulation leads to the important OOP concept of data hiding.</li>
    </ul>

    <img src="inheritance.png" width="40%"/>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">
Inheritance is the process by which objects of one class acquire the proterties of objects of <br/>
another class. This increases code reuseability.When creating a class instead of writing completely <br/>
new data memebers and member functions,the programmar can designate that the class should inherit the <br/>
members of an existing class.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">Different Types of Inheritance In OOP</h2>
<ul>
    <li> single Inheritance</li>
    <li> Multiple Inheritance</li>
    <li> Multi-Level Inheritance </li>
    <li> Hybrid Inheritance </li>
    <li> herarchical Inheritance</li>
</ul>
<br/>

<img src="polymorphism.jpg" width="40%"/>
<p style="font-size: larger;">
    polymorphism is the ability to exist in more than one form. An operation<br/>
    may exhibit different behavior in different instances. The behavior depends upon <br/>
    the operand provided. The word poly means many forms.it is ability to exist in more<br/>
    than one form. polymorphism, is extensively used in Inheritance.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center" > Polymorphism is Broadly Classified Into Two Types:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Complie Time Polymorphism</li>
    <li> Run Time Polymorphism </li>
</ul>
