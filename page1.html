    <b>Object oriented programming</b> can  be seen as an extension of <br/>
    procedural programming
    The major factor in the invention of object oriented is to remove some of the<br/> flaws encountered 
    in the procedural oriented approach. object oriented programming treats <br/>data as a critical elements in 
    the program development does no allow it to flow freely around the system. <br/>
    It ties data more closely to the function that operates on it and protects <br/>it from accidental 
     modification from outside world. <hr>

    FEATURES OF OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
</h1>
<ol style="font-size: 20px;
font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
    <li> More focus is on data rather than functions or procedures</li>
    <li> programs are divided into entities known as objects </li>
    <li> Data sturctures are desinged such that they characterize objects</li>
    <li> functions that operates on data are tied together in data structure</li>
    <li> Data is hidden external function cannot access data </li>
    <li> Object may communicate with each other through functions </li>
    <li> new data items and functions can be easily added whenever essential </li>
    <li> follows bottom up approach </li>
    <li> increase data security and integrity </li>
    <li> view data and function as a single entity </li>
