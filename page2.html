        BASIC CONCEPTS OF OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING 
    </h1>

        <ol>
            <li> <b> Class:</b> <br/> 
                <br/> The class contain data and function bundled together under a unit .in other words class is  <br/>
                        a collection of similar objects.when we define a class it just creates templates or skelton. </li>
<hr>
           <li><b> Object:</b> <br/>
            
            <br/>            Object are basic unit of opp.They are instances of class,which have data members <br/>
                        and use various member functions to perform tasks. </li>
<hr>
           <li><b> Data abstraction:</b> <br/>
            <br/>       Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information to  outside world  <br/>
                        and hiding their background deatail.</li>
<hr>
           <li><b> Encapsulation:</b> <br/>
            <br/>       Encapsulation is the method of combining the data and function inside a class <br/>
                        This hides the data from beind accessed from the outside world. <br/>
                        A wrapping of data and function into a single unit is known as encapsulation. </li>
<hr>
            <li><b> Inheritance:</b> <br/>
                <br/>        Inheritance is the process by which an object inherits properties of objects <br/>
                       of another class.This increase code reuseability. It allows user to create new <br/>
                        class from the existing class i.e derived class and base class.</li>
<hr>    
            <li><b> Polymorhism:</b> <br/>
                <br/>   Polymorphism is the ability to exhits in more than onr form. An operation may <br/>
                        exhibit different behaviour in different instances.The behaviour depends on the type <br/> 
                        of operand provided.</li>
<hr>
            <li><b> Message Passing:</b> <br/>
                <br/>   A message for an object is a request for execution of a function and  <br/>
                        therefore will involve a function in the receiving object that generates <br/>
                        the results. </li>
