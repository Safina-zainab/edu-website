<header> Object Oriented Programming</header>
<p>invention of object oriented is to remove some of the flaws encountered 
    in the procedural oriented approach. object oriented programming treats data as a critical elements in 
    the program development does no allow it to flow freely around the system. 
    It ties data more closely to the function that operates on it and protects it from accidental 
     modification from outside world.invention of object oriented is to remove some of the flaws encountered
